# DMPCitizens for DeathMessagesPrime

This plugin adds support for NPCs, such as those created by Citizens, to DeathMessagesPrime. Currently the plugin only allows hiding death messages by NPCs in certain worlds, but eventually the ability to customize the death messages for specific NPCs may also be added.

The configuration is fairly simple - you can set whether NPC death messages will be shown and also add per-world overrides.
